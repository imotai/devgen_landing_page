### Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Describe what you need. Instead of asking, "How do I fix this?", try “What causes the error in the setup instructions mentioned here?”
- **Add Context**: Reference specific parts of the issue, like file paths, error codes, or reproduction steps.
- **Break Down Complex Problems**: For detailed issues, ask about individual parts first.
- **Keep the Index Updated**: For actively updated repositories, update the index regularly for the most accurate responses.

### Use Cases

Here are some ways Devgen can help you work with issues in the side panel:

1. **Debugging Assistance**: Paste an error message or stack trace from an issue, and Devgen can suggest potential fixes or troubleshooting steps.

2. **Clarifying Issue Descriptions**: For complex issues, Devgen can help explain unclear parts of the description, dependencies, or reproduction steps.

3. **Suggesting Next Steps**: If you’re not sure what to do next in resolving an issue, ask Devgen for suggestions on additional tests or checks.

4. **Analyzing Linked Code**: When issues mention specific code files, Devgen can help you understand how that code relates to the issue.

5. **Documentation and Replication**: Devgen can assist with documentation or replication instructions, useful if the issue involves a complex setup or environment.
