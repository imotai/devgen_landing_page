title: Chat With Code File
---


With the **Devgen** n, you can chat with specific code files in a GitHub repository. This lets you ask detailed questions about the file's content, functionality, and structure.

1. Open the GitHub repository in Chrome.
2. Navigate to the code file you want to chat about.
3. Right-click on the GitHub blob page and select **Add to Chat**.
4. Open Devgen in the side panel by clicking its logo.
5. The selected file will be added to the chat context in Devgen. You can now type your questions to get insights about the file.

Ensure the repository index is set up if it’s not already, so Devgen can fully analyze the file content.

### Best Practices

- **Ask Specific Questions**: Focus on specific parts of the file for clearer responses. For example, “What does the `handleSubmit()` function do in this form component?”
- **Provide Context**: If your question involves multiple sections of the code, clarify which sections you’re referring to.
- **Start Small**: For large files, break down questions into smaller parts to get focused answers.


### Use Cases for Chatting with Code Files

1. **Detailed Code Explanations**: Ask Devgen to explain specific functions, methods, or classes in the file. For example, “What’s the purpose of `fetchData` in this file?”

2. **Debugging Assistance**: If you’re encountering an issue, describe the problem, and Devgen can help identify the source within the file and offer possible solutions.

3. **Understanding Dependencies**: For complex files, ask Devgen about dependencies or imports, e.g., “What modules does this file import, and how are they used?”

4. **Refactoring Guidance**: If you’re looking to improve code readability or performance, Devgen can point out areas in the file that might benefit from refactoring.

5. **In-File Documentation Support**: Use Devgen to quickly gather information about functions and sections within the file, making it easier to document its purpose and logic.
